A small collection of my favourite things. Just leaving them here so I can recall them in the future.

* Bushwalks
- [[https://www.walkmyworld.com/posts/winifred-falls][South West Arm Pool]] --- Small estuary in the Royal National Park. Accessible by boat or walking down Winifred Falls Firetrail from Wurumbul Road (4km return). Two or three good jump rocks and rope swings.
- [[https://www.newzealand.com/au/feature/rob-roy-glacier-track/][Rob Roy Glacier Track]] --- Cool approach down a dirt road, over a bunch of river crossings. Long uphill hike through some stunning landscapes. Rewarding view of Rob Roy Glacier at the end.

* Movies
- [[https://www.dominionmovement.com/watch][Dominion]] --- Confronting and very difficult to watch. Very important though.
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Max:_Fury_Road][Mad Max: Fury Road]] --- Amazing visuals and entertaining characters.
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Book_of_Eli][Book of Eli]] --- Post apocalyptic journey with a big twist at the end.
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wick_(film)][John Wick]] --- Perfect balance of unrealistic action and fun.

* Series
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mandalorian][The Mandalorian]] --- Nostalgic, yet new perspective to the Star Wars world.
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender][Avatar: The Last Airbender]] --- Easy to watch and some nuggets of wisdom.
- [[https://www.netflix.com/title/80189685][The Witcher]] --- Great universe and characters.
- [[https://www.netflix.com/title/80204890][Formula 1: Drive to Survive]] --- Got me into Formula 1.
- [[https://www.netflix.com/title/81122572][Middleditch & Schwartz]] --- A series of improv comedies on Netflix; very funny.

* Books
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game_(novel_series)][Ender's Game Novel Series]] --- Sci-fi that follows a child as he trains to defeat an alien civilisation. I particularly liked the Shadow Series that followed Bean, one of the side characters in Ender's Game.
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_of_Pi][Life of Pi]] --- Philosophical novel following a young boy lost at sea.
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Becky_Chambers_(author)][Wayfarers Series]] --- Set in a multi-species universe full of nice characters.
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapiens:_A_Brief_History_of_Humankind][Sapiens]] --- Incredibly interesting. The second book, Homo Deus, is also a great read.
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wheel_of_Time][Wheel of Time Series]] --- Read 3/14 so far, but I like it.
